# GuenniDiscordBot

### The idea

It all started a few years ago. I was bored  wanted to make the Discord Server I spend a lot of time on a little bit more interesting and fun. So I gave myself the callenge to build a little Discord Bot.
Because there are a lot of bots already out there I wanted to try something I haven't seen before on a Discord server. After some time the idea to welcome everyone that joins a voice channel was born and the development started.



### Made with:
üêç Python <br>
üê≥ Docker <br>
‚ù§Ô∏è Love <br>


### Features:
- Welcome people that join a voice channel
- Jokes
- Random facts
- Annoy everyone in a channel
- Give weather information about a city
- Insult people
- Say nice things to people
- Mute and unmute the bot for chosen channels



### TODO:
- permanent mute for a channel
- cleaning up a lot of shitty code
