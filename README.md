# GuenniDiscordBot

This bot is a small project I started a few years ago to entertain my friends discord server with another strange and fun bot. 
The main feature of this bot is joining voice channels and using text to speech to talk.



### Made with:
üêç Python <br>
üê≥ Docker <br>
‚ù§Ô∏è Love <br>


### Features:
- Welcome people that join a voice channel
- Jokes
- Random facts
- Annoy everyone in a channel
- Give weather information about a city
- Insult people
- Say nice things to people
- Mute and unmute the bot for chosen channels



### TODO:
- permanent mute for a channel
- cleaning up a lot of shitty code
